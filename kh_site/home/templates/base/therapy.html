      Get Past "Survivor Mode" and Start Thriving
    </h2>
    <p>
      Domestic violence is more complex than if someone is hitting you. It's a pattern of abusive behavior in ANY relationship,
      used by one party to gain power and control over another. Experiencing domestic violence, sexual assault, or childhood
      abuse can leave deep wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      These injuries show up in the form of negative relationships, emotional breakdowns, aimlessness, intense fear, and self-loathing.
      My work aims to support survivors and reverse these effects.

    <h3 class="text-center">The Healing Process</h3>
    <p class="">
      Clients often walk away from completing therapy with me empowered to design their lives.
      They shed the shame associated with their trauma by connecting with their intrinsic self-worth.
      They break the habit of hypervigilant, reactive, and avoidant behaviors that often accompanies trauma, while also developing a tolerance for joy without sabotage, and existing in the world with a deeper understanding of their values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clients leave therapy with a healthy way of communicating, perceiving, and relating to those closest to them; all the while reconnecting with their passion, curiosity, and “play”.
      I serve clients in gaining clarity regarding their life goals, their priorities, and their beliefs which then allows them to become the best versions of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This social justice perspective to counseling not only creates healing but also decreases the likelihood of finding yourself in future abusive environments.
      I serve and include Black people &amp; folks of color in therapy's healing process.
      By considering collective trauma and understanding that "pathology" is simply a normal reaction to abnormal/oppressive events.

      Healing Collective Trauma
    </h3>
    <p class="">
      Together we will explore how the collective trauma of racism, sexism, and other –isms impact your mental health.
      We will also explore your different identities (e.g. as gender, race, class) and uncover, challenge, and revise the beliefs that you had to align with in order to safely navigate these structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you have learned that in order to be safe you must give away your power, or, that having extreme control over yourself and others means you can avoid pain, then you understand the power of our environments to shape who we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      This social justice perspective to counseling not only creates healing but also decreases the likelihood of future abusive environments.

      Racial Trauma and Racial Identity Formation
    </h3>
    <p class="">
      During this era of Trump and the increased visibility of injustice many black people and people of color are finding it more important than ever to be <em><strong>solid</strong></em> in their racial identity.
      That means exploring their own internalized oppression, the negative messages that they heard growing up, colorism, and the specific impact that racism has had on their mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also work with biracial individuals who have parents that are different races (e.g. white mom and black dad) and find it hard to navigate the complexities of their racial identity.
      They have also found it difficult to have conversations about racism with family and felt unsupported in answering the tough questions about racism.
      I step in to offer support in the form of a nurturing, supportive environment where we tackle these issues collaboratively and without judgement.
