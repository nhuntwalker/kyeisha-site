      The Stress of Serving Those with Trauma
    </h2>
    <p>
      Listening to sometimes detailed stories of despair and bearing witnesses to the pain, fear, and terror that trauma survivors have endured can leave negative consequences.
      Healing professionals who do this sacred work can find themselves experiencing burnout, vicarious trauma, and compassion fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this stressful social climate the demand for healing professionals has risen and with it a need for us to intentionally <strong>practice self-care</strong>.
      However self-care still remains elusive, this led to the creation of Healing the Healers (HTH).
      Through workshops, and 1-on-1 or team coaching our services empower healers to live a quality of life that reflects their brilliance and strength.

      Self Care Mastery Coaching
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our services also support organizations and individuals by offering one-on-one and team coaching.
      HTH will contract with organizations to meet with their staff individually and within their teams.
      This role is known as the Trauma Stewardship Coach which is based off of the powerful book by Laura van Dernoot Lipsky titled "Trauma Stewardship: An Everyday Guide to Caring for Self While Caring for Others".
      It's an inspirational book that every Healer should read.

            Although one-on-one coaching is typically reserved for organizations I have decided to offer a limited number of healers a chance to have one-on-one trauma stewardship coaching.
